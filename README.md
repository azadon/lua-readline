# lua-readline
*lua-readline* is a simple interface to the readline and history libraries.

## What is it
This is a fork of [lua-readline](https://peterbillam.gitlab.io/pjb_lua/lua/readline.html) library originaly developed by [Peter Billam and with contribution of others](https://peterbillam.gitlab.io/pjb_lua/lua/readline.html#authors).

Because webpage where original source code was hosted isn't available anymore I downloaded the lates version from [debian's repository](https://salsa.debian.org/lua-team/lua-readline).
